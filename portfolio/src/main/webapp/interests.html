    <h2>Travelling</h2>
    <p>I've lived in Arizona my entire life and have always been 
      curious about how other places compare, from food to weather
      to landmarks. I haven't had much of a chance to explore, but
      I always take any opportunity I can when it comes to exploring.
      Here are some pictures of places I've visited:</p>
      <h4>Flagstaff, AZ</h4>

      <h4>The Grand Canyon</h4>

      <h4>Golden Gate Bridge</h4>
      <img src="/images/sanFran.jpg" alt="Selfie at a foggy view of Golden Gate Bridge">
      <h4>Yosemite</h4>
