            <h4>Pookie (Poo-key)🐕</h4>
            <p>A fierce, yet kind dog whose loyalty is unparalleled,
            whose <em>bark-power</em> is fearsome, and whose 
            smile uplifts anyone's mood.</p>

            <h4>Peluchin (Peh-loo-cheen)🐕</h4>
            <p>Peluchin is an energetic dog who loves chaos much more
            than his step-brother Pookie. Though some consider him a rascal,
            his frenzies indicate the love he has for people around him.</p>
